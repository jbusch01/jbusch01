### CSM | Aspiring Data Scientist | Aspiring Mechatronics Engineer | MagLev Systems Enthusiast

Hi, all! My name is Jonathan. I'm currently a CSM for a CAD software company. I work with around 100,000 Civil Engineers, supporting their software needs, troubleshooting pain points and issues they may have, and helping to drive new technology adoption within this space.

<summary><b>Aspiring Data Scientist</b></summary>
  I'm currently in school for my BS of Computer Science. I originally started down the path of finance and becoming a financial analyst. About two years into my degree, I realized the world didn't need more finance bros, and started exploring other options. I have always had a love for tech, including engineering and coding. Coding scared me, simply because I thought it was difficult and that I needed extensive training and experience in the industry just to even start. Once I started exploring Data Scientist roles, I realized that the world of Computer Science was right up my alley, and switched degrees shortly afterwards. I have an extreme propensity for pattern-spotting, problem-solving, and finding unique solutions to problems both big and small.

<summary><b>Aspiring Mechatronics Engineer</b></summary>
  Within my current field, I work with a lot of different types of engineers, from Civil to Electrical to Mechanical. All of them utilize the same software for designs and plan drafting. Getting to know this industry, I realized I also had a strong interest in different types of engineering fields. From there, I learned of the Mechatronics Engineering field, which is a cross-section of Electrical/Mechanical/Software Engineering. This field gives you a working understanding of each field, allowing you to be a self-sufficient systems developer for robotics, automation, and cross-functional systems. Given the trend our technology is heading in, I can only see this field growing, given the extreme need for seamless integrations across multiple technologies.

  My interest in MagLev systems is arguably what led me to actively pursue a Mechatronics Engineering degree. I live in Colorado, where our Governor just granted 45 acres of land to SwissPODS, a Hyperloop Developmnent Company. During my research on this project and company, I wandered far down the rabbit hole of Hyperloop technology, Japan's MagLev train system, as well as other domestic projects centered on all-electric maglev tracks designed for personal transport. This last rabbit hole led me to discover a project called SkyTran, which was abandoned due to lack of funding. Within 3 weeks of starting my research, I had hypothesized an energy-efficient MagLev personal transport system, worked out the math on the hypotheticals of energy consumption and speeds, realizing that a speed of 200+ mph (250 mph if we're being optimistic) is not only viable, but energy efficient at specific weights and distances. After fixating on this hobby project, I realized that not only was I grasping the concepts and understanding the different technologies involved, but that I was enthusiastic to have a deeper understanding of these systems and the possibilities. My hope is to gain enough experience through my own research and studies to develop a working meglev model to simulate and narrow down the actual numbers, not just the hypotheticals. Is my math perfect and completely accurate? Probably not. But I won't know until I learn, then try 🤷‍♂️

The goal with my GitHub profile is to start getting more real world practice and experience with coding and projects. I plan to complete my Computer Science degree, establish myself as a Data Scientist, then continue workng towards my Mechatronics Engineering degree, where I hope to break into more advanced areas of Research and Development.
